* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/summer_internship_for_tech_excellence/prework]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[One of the challenges I had when creating the application is the implementation execution of the start and stop button. One of the issues is when the user pressed start, the stop button would keep showing even after the stop was pressed. ]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[One of the questions that I have concerning web development is the use of var. 
As of now, var will be a depreciated type that is not recommended since by default it is global. My other question with Web Development after completing this project and debugging it is how to make the game a local mutliplayer project.
For instance, if I wanted to have it locally implemented how would I do this using web hooks or another framework? If it is not local, what about multiplayer options for the game? I also did not know that Javascript had its own built-in sound library, which is a good surprise.
What if I wanted to add my own custom sounds to the project?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I would add other features such as the different coloration of the buttons instead of using the default. I would also add my own custom sounds to the game as well. 
I would also modify the buttons to show graphic pictures like a memory card game with sound included. 
I would also do a random secret pattern of tones as well.]
